Composition Techniques

1.Nested routes. (Child Components also can have its own routing configuration with ng-outlet to load its component)

  *But set the root level component route config to match this nested routing.

2. Decoupling the component - star rating component (any component can access)
3. Creating coupled component - eg., panel-group bootstrap class having relationship with panel-heading panel-body
